<h3><div style="text-align:center">The main content of this project is to make a website that can handle the flow of information reasonably. Its values are that people can browse the files needed for downloading information with confidence, without worrying about downloading viruses. At the same time, the efficiency of downloading information and the search speed are faster. The method is to set up a website, search all the information about the keyword immediately after the customer inputs the keyword, and comprehensively analyze whether the information contains viruses, if not, push it to the customer, and if so, blacken the information source.</div></h3>

<h3 style="text-align">In our hardware, the protection technology of firewall is the most advanced at present. Once a virus is found, it will be intercepted and hacked immediately. In addition, we use Huawei's router, which can read data quickly and cover a wide range. We use Amazon's RDS software to store a large amount of cloud data, which can provide you with more content.</h3>
